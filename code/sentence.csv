"Finally , Mr President , Mr Santer among others spoke of taking a fresh look at institutional policy ."
This is a genuine flaw in European democracy .
... and to have a State of Israel that can live in safety .
I welcome the fact that the Commission is investigating whether or not the general good clause is being misused .
"It is in our hands to create the process and structures that will give peace roots , help it grow and sustain it into the future ."
I urge you to share in this effort .
Our partnership can create an historic transformation and a rich harvest - years of peace and prosperity that will benefit our peoples and our world .
( The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation )
"Your Majesty , we thank you for your visit to the European Parliament ."
We thank you for this great speech .
We are all - and the applause showed this - deeply touched by your convictions .
"There are few personalities , few leaders , who are as committed as you to peace in the Middle East ."
"You call us friends , and I say to you , on behalf of the European Parliament : We are at your side to create a Palestinian State that can live in safety ..."
( Applause )
... and to have a State of Israel that can live in safety .
The effects are dedramatized and minimized .
"The tactic is to associate synthetic drugs with a new and attractive youth culture , to associate them with dancing , music and a strong feeling of togetherness ."
"Gone are the unpleasant needles , the nasty smelling pipes and the give-away smell of smoke ."
The strategy has so far been effective .
The EU Heads of State or Government raised the problem at the Dublin Summit in 1996 .
Immediately thereafter I and my officials brought a number of proposals forward for concrete action .
One of our starting points was that it takes too long today to ban new substances that keep appearing .
UN conventions are quite simply not enough .
The result is that it becomes difficult for prosecutors and the police to work effectively .
"Another starting point was that the input from the Member States in this area needs to be better coordinated , not least making use of one another &apos;s resources and expertise ."
The conclusion was that improvements were needed on three points .
"Firstly , we have to create a more effective system of exchange of information between Member States ."
"Secondly , we need to be able to make joint and scientifically based risk assessments ."
"Thirdly , we must see to it that synthetic drugs are banned rapidly in all Member States ; it is not good enough for one or two Member States to act ; joint action is needed ."
This is also the significance of the joint action adopted by the Council of Ministers on 16 June 1997 .
It has been extremely heartening to see how intensively both Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon have worked to implement this decision .
The result today is that we have a well functioning information system .
"Before the end of the year the first joint scientific analysis of a new form of Ecstasy , called MBDB , will also have been completed ."
Then the Council of Ministers will have one month to take appropriate measures .
"In Mr Pirker &apos;s report there is a recommendation to include too the central and eastern European countries in this work , a thought I support wholeheartedly ."
"During my travels in many applicant countries , it has been repeatedly confirmed to me that the manufacture of and addiction to amphetamine , methamphetamine and Ecstasy is rapidly spreading there as well ."
"It is therefore , without the slightest doubt , in our own interest to include these countries as soon as possible in the fight against drugs ."
The idea to associate the applicant countries with the decision on a joint action to combat synthetic drugs will also be discussed at the Council meeting at the end of this month .
My hope is that we will be able to go further still .
"I am in the process of identifying all the agreements reached by the Council of Ministers in the sphere of the third pillar , and to which the applicant countries can affiliate themselves more or less straight away ."
Another point that Mr Pirker raises in his report deals with the control of chemical precursors .
This is a question I also mentioned in the 1996 communication on synthetic drugs .
"I then pointed out the need for reinforcing the control of chemical base elements , used in the manufacture of the new synthetic drugs ."
I can mention here that the Commission has already put forward amendments to the two directives which today regulate the manufacture and trade of these base elements .
"These amendments have , by the way , already been forwarded to the European Parliament for opinions ."
"Mr President , that the EU now takes up the struggle against synthetic drugs is of great importance for our international credibility ."
"Combating drugs will , as you know , be high on the agenda of the United Nations &apos; special session on drugs in June this year ."
"Today a frighteningly large proportion of the manufacture of amphetamines , methamphetamines and Ecstasy takes place within the EU circle ."
It is therefore about time we swept our own front doorstep clean .
"The special session in New York in early June is , to my mind , one of the most important of this year &apos;s UN meetings ."
"The Council of Ministers is busily preparing for it , and , as you will know , the Commission has contributed to that work with a communication presenting our thoughts and ideas ."
"This communication is at present being scrutinized by Parliament , I hope ."
"I shall be present myself in New York together with my colleague , Commissioner Marin ."
"The Commission would welcome the presence of Parliament , too , at this important meeting ."
We are therefore in the process of looking into the possibility of including representatives from the European Parliament in the delegation from the Commission .
"As far as I understand , the prospects for this look good ."
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon .
Preliminary draft general budget for 1999 ( presentation )
The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft budget for 1999 .
"Thank you , Mr President and thank you , Commissioner Liikanen , for your thorough presentation of the preliminary draft budget for 1999 ."
"I also want to thank you for having presented your preliminary draft earlier than expected , which means we can work on the budget ahead of schedule this year ."
"This will allow us to hold three-way talks with the Council on 17 July , instead of at the end of that month , and means that this Parliament and the relevant committees do not have to panic about the first reading ."
"I also want to say that , in broad terms , this Parliament has already expressed its priorities for the 1999 budget and although we agree that it has to be a rigorous budget the Union &apos;s commitments should not be compromised just for the sake of the endof-year figures ."
"In any case , Commissioner , this is not the time to start a debate ."
"So I will content myself with thanking you for your presentation and pointing out that there are some details we cannot go along with , on which the relevant committees will have to state their opinion ."
All that glitters is not gold .
"There is one point I would like to stress : you know very well , Commissioner , that your supplementary and amending budget does not solve the problem , in this 1999 budget , of the discrepancy between commitments and payments ."
I hope a solution will emerge during the deliberations .
"Otherwise , Commissioner , thank you for your collaboration and I hope that between us all - yourselves , Parliament and the Council too - we can steer this budget to a happy conclusion ."
"Mr President , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop asked whether the discrepancy between commitments and payments remains in 1998 ."
What we are proposing is to add some ECU 560m to the payment credits of the Social Fund .
That is because of the situation where the payment credits have not been sufficient to cover all the commitments .
At the end of the last year some expenditure in the Social Fund had to be postponed to the following year .
"To try to alleviate the situation so that this would not happen to any great extent , we have added this ECU 560m ."
We do not know if it is entirely sufficient but at least it will make it a bit easier .
The debate is closed .
Tobacco advertising
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A4-0150 / 98 ) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on the approximation of the laws , regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products ( C4-0034 / 98-00 / 0194 ( COD ) ) ( Rapporteur : Mr Christian Cabrol ) ."
"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are today going to give an opinion on the common position of the Council with regard to the proposal for a directive on - and I would like to emphasize the title - the approximation of national legislations relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products ."
"Firstly , to cut short any discussion on the subject , I would like to say that this directive has a firm legal basis in Article 100a , since , as its title indicates , its aim is to remove the profound differences which exist between the legislative provisions of Member States , profound differences of a nature which would hinder the freedom to provide services in this domain and cause distortions in competition impeding the functioning of the single market ."
"I would therefore like to repeat that there is no problem with regard to the legal basis of this report . This was , moreover , confirmed by Parliament &apos;s legal service in an opinion dated 27 March 1998 , although even the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights would have had us believe otherwise ."
"Article 100a was , furthermore , confirmed as the appropriate legal basis by the European Parliament at first reading and has been questioned by none of the institutions participating in the subsequent legislative process ."
The adoption of amendments challenging the legal basis would make an absolute nonsense of this second reading and I would like to request formally that they be rejected .
"Secondly , I would also like to stress that Article 100a is absolutely appropriate in this case for , in paragraph 3 , it explicitly provides that the European Commission , when proposing measures relating to the operation of the single market and touching upon issues of consumer health and protection , must take as its basis a high level of protection for those consumers ."
"That is thus the case with this directive which , in order to do so , brings currently divergent national measures into line , through a ban on direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products in order to obtain a high level of consumer protection ."
"For tobacco kills : 500 000 people pay the price every year in the European Union , be it cancer of the mouth , the airways , the lungs or the bladder , be it diseases of the heart or arteries , or illness through passive smoking , for example , children suffering from chronic respiratory conditions because their parents smoke ."
Tobacco advertising encourages smoking and creates this senseless mortality rate .
"To encourage people to smoke is truly inciting them to murder , all in the name of the financial interests of the tobacco producing firms ."
"Thirdly and finally , this common position will be satisfactory to Parliament in that it takes on board the majority of amendments proposed at first reading ."
"The text is clearly not perfect , but it does make considerable progress in this field ."
"Whilst banning direct and indirect tobacco advertising , it leaves to Member States , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , the task of regulating certain areas and provides a deadline of three years hence for national provisions to be imposed ."
It also provides extended deadlines with regard to the press and sponsorship .
"In its current state it is thus the best compromise possible , allowing time for all the necessary economic adjustments , of which I am well aware ."
"As you know , this text is the result of very difficult discussions which have lasted nearly ten years ."
"That is why , in order to avoid opening up new discussions which might risk breaking this fragile balance and might delay unduly , even postpone sine dia this directive , we have requested that it be adopted without amendment ."
"Yet , in spite of this recommendation , this common position is the subject of a veritable flood of amendments ."
"Make no mistake , ladies and gentlemen , although some of these amendments have been made in good faith , out of concern for improving the common position - which risk ruining it however - the majority of these amendments have been submitted by experienced parliamentarians , fully aware of what they are aiming to achieve , under the influence of certain pressure groups , and in no way - and I have proof of this - supported by public opinion in their countries ."
"In reality , their amendments are merely pretexts to make this directive fail by means of successive procedures ."
Such a thing is unacceptable .
"This attitude on the part of Members is incomprehensible , especially given that they are so demanding when it comes to defending air or water quality , lack of which can certainly be dangerous , but a lot less so than tobacco consumption ."
"So , ladies and gentlemen , let us not stand guilty of this mass homicide in the face of history but let us adopt this common position as it stands in order to obtain commercial regulation of - and I will emphasize it once more - advertising , which needs to be uniform throughout the European Union , so that incitement to such self-destruction , such absurd self-mutilation , will finally come to an end ."
"Mr President , as a non-smoker I have others who smoke to thank for my cough ."
I agree with Professor Cabrol &apos;s passionate plea to drive back tobacco .
"He argued the case before the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection for a general ban on tobacco to be proclaimed on the grounds of public health ."
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights did not talk about tobacco .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights did not talk about public health .
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights asked itself whether a total ban on advertising would further the operation of the single market , yes or no ."
"It is obvious that a ban on cars or alcoholic drinks is the antithesis of furthering the operation of the single market , so Article 100a is not the right means ."
"The German Bundestag has already decided to bring it before the Court of Justice ; not Parliament , not the Commission , not the Council , but the Court of Justice , which always follows the rule if there is a special article in the Treaty on the subject ."
That will also be used and not a general article .
"In other words , if this directive is accepted , the Court of Justice will reject it because there is no legal basis for it ."
There is a basis .
"Since Maastricht , there has been Article 129 which calls on us to promote public health and the route for those who want to ban tobacco is Article 129 of the Treaty ."
"There are more victims of car use , innocent third parties ."
"If people want to reduce the use of the car on public health grounds by banning advertising which restricts trade and hinders the operation of the internal market , they should do so on the grounds of Article 129 ."
"Professor Cabrol will get my support on that , but this is absolutely the wrong method ."
That is why it is being referred back to the Commission .
The Council &apos;s legal service has also said no .
"Mr President , on Parliament &apos;s own initiative , we have spent nearly nine years , during one presidency after another , trying to ban direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products within the Union , together with the sponsorship of sporting events ."
"The damage tobacco does to the health of both active and passive smokers is only too well known , and we Members who have spent nearly a decade on this attempt have repeated them endlessly ."
"Tobacco kills , as Professor Cabrol said ."
Its consumption is linked to 30 % of all cancers .
"It is also the leading cause of premature death : more than half a million people die in the Union every year because of this fatal habit which has been promoted for years . Additives have even been added in a criminal fashion to increase addiction among adolescents and children , some of them just five years old ."
"That is really monstrous , Mr President ."
"I am not even going to mention those irrational arguments based on suspect reasoning , such as saying that cars are dangerous too . What we are talking about here today is protecting people &apos;s health and life , not luring them , as the tobacco companies do , towards a process of disease and sorrow for the sake of private financial interests ."
There is no doubt that direct and indirect advertising and the sponsorship of sporting events have played and continue to play an important role in the promotion of tobacco consumption among young people .
We all know that .
"But there are too many financial interests behind it , as was made patently clear by the scandalous attempt at an agreement on the part of the North American tobacco companies ."
The common position we are now considering is a first step . It is the result of a compromise which has not been at all easy .
